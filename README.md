This project creates a superquadric ellipsoid with a texture image. The bulge factors of the quadric can be modified. In order to run the program, the user needs to extract all files in the same directory and open quadric.html in an internet browser.

The files included are:

quadric.html
quadric.js
matrix.js
sample.jpg
originalSize.jpg
README.md

If a user wants to view different texture image, simply replace sample.jpg with a different image of the same name, or replace the reference to 'sample.jpg' on line 228 of quadric.html
